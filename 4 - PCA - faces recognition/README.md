Faces recognition example using eigenfaces and SVMs

Our discussion of PCA spent a lot of time on theoretical issues, so in this mini-project weâ€™ll ask you to play around with some sklearn code. The eigenfaces code is interesting and rich enough to serve as the testbed for this entire mini-project.
Note: The dataset used in this example is a preprocessed excerpt of the "Labeled Faces in the Wild", aka LFW_ Download (233MB). Original source.
